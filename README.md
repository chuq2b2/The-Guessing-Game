# The-Guessing-Game
## Description
This is my class project where I followed instructions and utilized Java to implement a graph data structure with 3 decision trees and graphical user interfaces (GUI), interacting with the users to guess their character. Furthermore, I learnt about how to generate decision tree using an artificial intelligence algorithm â€“ ID3.
